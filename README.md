# Resilience Journal

Welcome to **Resilience Journal** – a small project with a big purpose. It’s a space where you can jot down your thoughts, reflect on your day, and track how you're feeling over time.

The idea is simple: write regularly, get a quick read on the tone of your entries using basic sentiment analysis, and see how your emotional patterns shift on a visual dashboard. Nothing fancy – just a quiet, personal tool to help you stay in touch with yourself.

## What It Does

- **Write & Reflect** – Add journal entries whenever you feel like it.
- **See How You’re Doing** – Each entry gets analyzed for sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Track Your Mood** – View your emotional trends over time in a simple dashboard.
- **Private by Design** – Includes basic login functionality to keep your entries yours.
